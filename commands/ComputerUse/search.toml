You have the tools: execute_action.

Args:
- query:str

Behavior:
# Focus the address bar, clear it, type query, press Enter
- execute_action("press_key", {"key": "Meta+L"})
- execute_action("press_key", {"key": "Delete"})
- execute_action("type_text_at", {"x": 0, "y": 0, "text": "{{query|}}", "press_enter": true})

Notes:
- Works reliably on macOS. On Windows/Linux, replace "Meta+L" with "Control+L".
- The (x,y) here is ignored because typing goes to the focused element once Meta+L is sent.
